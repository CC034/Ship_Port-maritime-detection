# Real-Time Ship and Port Detection Using Multispectral Satellite Data

## 1. **Summary of What I Built:**

I have developed a **real-time ship and port detection system** using **multispectral satellite imagery** from **Sentinel-2A** and **ResourceSAT-2A**. This project leverages **data fusion** to enhance the spatial resolution and uses a **Faster R-CNN model** for accurate object detection of ships and ports. This system has the potential to revolutionize maritime surveillance by providing real-time monitoring, which can help with **coastal security**, **illegal fishing detection**, and **maritime traffic management**.

## 2. **How I Built It:**

- **Data Fusion**: By combining **coarse resolution (Sentinel-2A)** and **fine resolution (ResourceSAT-2A)** imagery, I created a **highly accurate and detailed dataset** that overcomes the challenges of cloud cover and varying resolution.
- **Deep Learning Model**: I implemented the **Faster R-CNN** model to detect ships and ports from the satellite images. The model has been fine-tuned for the specific characteristics of maritime satellite imagery to achieve high precision.
- **Cloud Removal**: I developed a custom method for **cloud detection and removal** to ensure clean images for accurate detection, which is a significant challenge in satellite image analysis.

## 3. **How This Project Can Benefit from Cerebras Inference:**

- **Enhanced Inference Speed**: While my current setup works well, processing satellite imagery at **large scales** and **real-time inference** would be significantly more efficient with **Cerebras hardware**. The **Cerebras CS-2**’s ability to handle large batches and high-resolution data in real-time would allow for **much faster processing**, ensuring quicker decision-making for time-sensitive applications such as border control or emergency response.
- **Scalability**: With Cerebras, I could scale the project to cover larger maritime areas and process **multiple satellite passes** in real-time. This would make the system more robust and capable of handling massive data streams, which is essential for global maritime surveillance.
- **Higher Throughput**: By utilizing Cerebras’ **10x faster inference**, I could process **more satellite images per second**, leading to higher **throughput** and enabling broader coverage of maritime zones. This would improve the **timeliness** of detection alerts for ships and ports, enhancing **operational effectiveness** in critical areas.

## 4. **Future Roadmap:**

- **Integration with Cerebras**: In the future, I plan to fully integrate this model with the **Cerebras CS-2** system to demonstrate how Cerebras can unlock **superior speed** and **real-time deployment** for maritime monitoring at scale.
- **Extended Use Cases**: This technology could be further developed to detect **illegal fishing**, **oil spills**, or **unregistered vessels** by combining the satellite imagery with **AIS data** and **machine learning techniques**. With Cerebras’ accelerated inference, this extended use case can be processed across **multiple regions simultaneously**.
- **Edge Deployment**: Another phase would involve developing **lightweight edge models** for deployment on drones or buoys to create a **distributed network** for monitoring coastal areas. This system would allow for continuous surveillance with minimal latency.
